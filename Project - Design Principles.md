## Chapter Redesign

1. Fitt's Law
2. Gestalt - Continuoes (make it in a horizontal line)

## Ad Video (Remove Functionality)

1. Flexibility and usability tradeoff: In YouTube, the ads that show up on the homepage, have a watch and sign up button below them. Which breaks the consistency of the site and opposes the mental model of how user interacts with videos on youtube. In the app as of now, when I click the video preview, it takes me to the site instead of the video. It is only when I click watch button beneath it, I can watch the video. There is a sign up button besides it that is totally unnecessary. As it is misleading the user into thinking they will sign up. Instead they go to the external site and depending on if the site has a registration form, it opens that up. But then again, not every site will have that.
2. Feedforward ?

1. Multitasking: The video is paused when users have some other behaviors
